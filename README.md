# Directed Weighted Graph
**Created by Eldad Tsemach and Ilan Sirisky**
 
This project is a part of our Object Oriented Programming course in Java.
The above project deals with the implementation of a Directed Weighted graph, using Nodes and Edges.
As well as implementing a number of algorithms on the graph.

## List of algorithms
1. Checking if a DW graph is strongly connected by using the DFS algorithm.

2. Finding the shortest path between source and destination nodes by using Dijkstra algorithm.

3. Finding the center of a DW graph which minimizes the max distance to all the other nodes.
4. Computing a list of consecutive nodes which go over a list of nodes and finding the least costing path between all the nodes,
        similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem but without the limitaion of visiting each node only once.
5. Saving and loading a graph to and from a .json file which contains an array of Edges and Nodes.

The Dijkstra algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes in a DW graph.

## Code Description
- `GeoLocation.java` and `NodeData.java` : Implements and represents the vertices of the graph.
- `EdgeData.java`: Implements and represents the edges of the graph.
- `WeightedDirectedGraph.java`: Implements the graph itself, by using 2 hashmaps one for NodeData and the other for EdgeData.
- `Algorithms.java`: Implements all the algorithms that are listed above.
- `GUI` and `LoadScreen`: are part of the GUI.


## Dependencies
This project is using Java version 15.
The tests included in this project are on JUnit version 5.7.
Reading and writing the json files are based on Gson version 2.8.6.

# How to Run
To run this project, download th EX2.jar and /data folder, and place them in the same folder.
- *Option 1* : Run from GUI
After you have downloaded the files neccessary (Ex2.jar, /data) run Ex2.jar, enter a path to a json file in the loading screen.
Select to run an algorithm from the menu.
You can also choose to load or save a new json file from the menu.
- *Option 2* : run form CLI
After you have downloaded the files neccessary (Ex2.jar, /data), open a terminal at the current folder, and type:
`java -jar Ex2.jar G1.json `, or any json file.

## Input/Output Examples
### Example for G1.json input :

##### In Edges :
- *src* : the ID of the source node.
- *w* : the weight of the edge.
- *dest* : the ID of the destination node.

##### In Nodes :
- *pos* : containing the GeoLocation of the node based on x,y,z.
- *id* : the ID of the node.
